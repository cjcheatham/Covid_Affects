## My Section: Consumer Spending Trends from Jan. 2020 - Dec. 2023

**National Level - Monthly Percentage Change in Consumer Spending**
Using data collected by [Affinity Solutions](https://www.affinity.solutions/) I analyzed the monthly percentage change in credit/debit card spending for US consumers for a variety of categories.  
The Consumer Spending categories are listed below, along with their descriptions:  

    'spend_all': 'Total Spending'
    'spend_aap': 'Spending in Apparel and Accessories'  
    'spend_acf': 'Spending in Accommodation and Food Services'  
    'spend_aer': 'Spending in Arts, Entertainment, and Recreation'  
    'spend_gen': 'Spending in General Merchandise Stores'  
    'spend_grf': 'Spending in Grocery and Food Stores'  
    'spend_hcs': 'Spending in Health Care and Social Assistance'  
    'spend_hic': 'Spending in Home Improvement Centers'  
    'spend_sgh': 'Spending in Sporting Goods and Hobby'  
    'spend_tws': 'Spending in Transportation'  
    'spend_retail_w_grocery': 'Spending in Retail Including Grocery Spending'  
    'spend_retail_no_grocery': 'Spending in Retail Excluding Grocery Spending'  
    'spend_durables': 'Spending in Durable Goods'  
    'spend_nondurables': 'Spending in Non-Durable Goods'  
    'spend_remoteservices': 'Spending in Remote Services'  
    'spend_inperson': 'Spending in In-Person Services'  

**1. Percent Change in Total Consumer Spending (Jan. 20202 to December 2023)**
   - With the first case of Covid offically being diagnosed in late January of 2020, consumer spending did not decrease much in February (-0.8%).
   - However, as the nation became more of aware of this deadly virus in the following weeks, consumer spending declined. Unsurprisingly, total consumer spending saw its lowest point shortly after the nationwide lockdown was announced.
     The lockdown was announced in March and within just one month, **nationwide consumer spending dropped by about 28% in April.**
   - It took a full year for consumer spending to increase month-to-month; **Total consumer spending declined from Jan. 2020 to Jan. 2021.**
   - Fortunately, as the rest of the chart depicts, **the economy gradually recovered from the pandemic, seeing positive GDP growth as soon as Jan. 2021.**

**2. Total Consumer Spending v.s. Consumer Spending in Transportation**
   - A category that was of interest for us was Transportation/Engery.
   - As expected, with the lockdown taking place and most of us afraid of contracting the Covid-19 virus, Transportation and Energy consumption saw a decline. However, what did come as a surprise was the extent of the decline in Transportion in comparison to the Total Consumer Spending, as well as their recoveries.
   - As mentioned earlirer, a month after lockdowns were announced, **Total Consumer Spending had declined by approximately 28% since Covid-19**. Whereas, **Transportation/Energy consumption dropped by as much as 75% by April** which is a significant difference.
   - Furthermore, while total consumer spending returned to its pre-Covid levels by Jan. 2021, spending in Transportion did not unitl May of 2022, about a a year and a half after the lockdown ended here in the US.

**3. Consumer Spending in In-Person Services v.s. Remote Services**   
    -As the following chart displays, **remote services saw a tremendous growth during Covid**, with Covid bringing the age of hybrid work and schooling. 
    -Only a small fraction of schools offered online coureses and hybrid work was not a common thing.  
    -This is not necessarily a bad thing as it allows for more flexiable schedules, accommadates for different lifestyles/living arrangements, and grants access to opportunties that weren't otherwise an option.
