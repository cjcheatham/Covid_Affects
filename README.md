1. Percent Change in Total Consumer Spending (Jan. 20202 to December 2023)
   - With the first case of Covid offically being diagnosed in late January of 2020, consumer spending did not decrease much in February (-0.8%).
   - However, as the nation became more of aware of this deadly virus in the following weeks, consumer spending declined. Unsurprisingly, total consumer spending saw its lowest point shortly after the nationwide lockdown was announced.
     The lockdown was announced in March and within just one month, **nationwide consumer spending dropped by about 28% in April.**
   - It took a full year for consumer spending to increase month-to-month; **Total consumer spending declined from Jan. 2020 to Jan. 2021.**
   - Fortunately, as the rest of the chart depicts, **the economy gradually recovered from the pandemic, seeing positive GDP growth as soon as Jan. 2021.**
